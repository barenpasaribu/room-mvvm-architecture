# Learn about MVVM Architecture - Room + ViewModel + LiveData + Dependency Injection (Hilt)
  
- First app is not use Dependency Injection (DI), but i implement DI on this branch [implement-hilt](https://github.com/im-o/room-mvvm-architecture/tree/implement-hilt)  
- If you want to see my code before use DI, see this branch [hacktoberfest-2020](https://github.com/im-o/room-mvvm-architecture/tree/hacktoberfest-2020)
- I rewrite this code from youtube [Coding in Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARpn-1FPNE4&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuDihTpkRs6SpZhqgBqPU118) and not use DI.  
- In this case we'll be rewrite this course and refactor code from Java to Kotlin.
